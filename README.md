<H2>Troubleshooting</H2>

- Reboot ProtonVPN if you experience any connection issues
- Ensure you have an Internet connection before connecting
- Check if firewall settings are enabled (I don't advise disabling for an extended time, only to find the issue)
- If none of these work, contact [customer support.](https://protonvpn.com/support/contact)
